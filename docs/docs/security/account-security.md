## Best Practices

### Secure Your Email

Your email is your primary security factor:

- ✅ Use strong, unique password
- ✅ Enable 2FA on email account
- ✅ Don't share email access
- ✅ Monitor for suspicious activity

### Account Hygiene

- ✅ Don't share magic links
- ✅ Log out on shared devices
- ✅ Review active positions regularly
- ✅ Delete unused positions

## If Your Account is Compromised

1. Delete all API keys from trading platforms
2. Remove all positions from WhisperHedge
3. Contact support immediately
4. Review platform security logs
5. Change email password if needed
