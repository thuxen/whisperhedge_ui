# Position Not Updating

What to do when your position data isn't refreshing.

## Check Update Frequency

Positions update based on your plan:
- Free: Every 15 minutes
- Pro: Every 5 minutes
- Premium: Every 1 minute

Wait for the next scheduled update or use manual refresh.

## Manual Refresh

1. Click refresh button on dashboard
2. Or refresh individual position
3. Wait 10-30 seconds for data

## Common Causes

### API Key Issues
- Key permissions insufficient
- Key deleted from platform
- Wrong subaccount

**Solution:** Verify API key in platform

### Plan Limits Exceeded
- TVL over limit
- Too many positions

**Solution:** Upgrade plan or remove positions

### Network Issues
- Blockchain RPC down
- API rate limits
- Connectivity problems

**Solution:** Wait and try manual refresh

### Position Closed
- Position no longer exists
- Liquidity removed

**Solution:** Remove position from WhisperHedge

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. Check plan limits in dashboard
2. Verify API key still exists
3. Try manual refresh
4. Wait 15 minutes
5. Check platform for position
6. Contact support if persists
